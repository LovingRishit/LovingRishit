## 💼 Experience

### 🧪 Research Intern – IIT Roorkee *(May–July 2024)*  
- Achieved **99.52% malware detection accuracy** using Random Forest on APK features  
- Built dual-layered detection: static (Androguard) + dynamic (Genymotion, Wireshark)  
- Immutably stored malware signatures on Ethereum via smart contracts  
- Resulted in a tamper-proof threat intelligence system 🚨

### 🛰️ Samsung PRISM – Link Prediction *(Sep 2024–Mar 2025)*  
- Co-authored a research paper on **Link Prediction for SQL DBs**  
- Developed a **graph-based engine** for identifying latent relationships in messy, large-scale data  
- Handled real-world data with 37,000+ entries across complex relational structures  
- Blended academic rigor with industrial precision

---

## 🧠 Key Highlights

- 🏆 **Built a malware detection system backed by blockchain** — full pipeline from APK parsing to smart contract deployment  
- 💡 **Engineered a graph traversal algorithm** for discovering hidden relationships in enterprise SQL tables  
- 💬 **Presented research** to top mentors at Samsung and IIT, with positive feedback and cross-team interest  
- 🧩 Designed tools that reduce manual labor by **90%**, improve transparency, and scale efficiently

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🛡️ Blockchain-based APK Malware Detection  
A hybrid security pipeline that parses APKs, extracts static/dynamic features, classifies malware, and stores hashes on-chain — **built for transparency and zero-trust systems**.

### 🔗 SQL Graph Link Prediction (Samsung PRISM)  
Modelled relational databases as graphs and used **MultiDiGraph** with path-finding to expose hidden links. Tuned for large datasets with low latency.

### 🌐 Network Threat Analyzer  
Automated Wireshark pipeline to label malicious vs benign traffic — reduced analysis time by **90%** and integrated with a real-time ML model.
